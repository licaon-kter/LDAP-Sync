LDAP-Sync can sync entries from a remote LDAP server to your phone's Contacts, making them available offline. They are then accessible to all apps with permission to read your address book. It works read-only and never changes data on the remote server. 

## Usage
Find some explanations on how to use the app and how to generate configuration templates on the [documentation page](https://max-weller.github.io/LDAP-Sync/).
