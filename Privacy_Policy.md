# Privacy Policy for LDAP-Sync NT

## This app will not send any data to third parties
This app communicates only with the LDAP servers which are configured by the user themselves.
The user's LDAP servers will see the IP address from which the connection is made, the configured user credentials, and the search filter as configured. As these LDAP servers are outside the control of the authors of this app, therefore we don't know whether the LDAP servers will log or store this data.

No other internet connections are made. The authors of the app do not collect any data about the user, their devices or their behaviour.



## Note regarding behaviour of other apps
The synchronized LDAP contacts are placed in the address book of the user's phone. Other apps can retrieve them from there and use them according to their privacy policies. For example, many messenger apps will send all phone numbers in your address book to their server, which will then include the phone numbers which LDAP-Sync has placed on your phone according to your configuration. Please check beforehand if that's what you want and if you're allowed to do that.
